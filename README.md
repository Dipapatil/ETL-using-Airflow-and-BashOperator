# ETL-using-Airflow-and-BashOperator
Analyzed road traffic data from multiple toll plazas across different highways, each managed by distinct toll operators using varied IT systems and file formats. Consolidated heterogeneous data sources into a unified, standardized file for streamlined analysis and reporting.
This project is completed on Courseraâ€™s cloud environment

## Tools Used: Apache Airflow, Python, Kafka


##	Extract data from a csv file

##	Submit a DAG
* Export AIRFLOW_HOME=/home/project/airflow
* 	Cp ETL_toll_data.py $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags

##	Verify if DAG is submitted or not
![Submit DAG](https://github.com/Dipapatil/ETL-using-Airflow-and-BashOperator/blob/main/submit_dag.png)

##	If can not find DAG then run below command to check errors, resolve error delete python file from dag folder and again copy using above cp command.
*	Airflow dags list-import-errors

## Kafka real time data pipeline : road traffic data from national hiway toll plaza, as vehical pass through key data- vehical id, type, toll plaza id and timestamp is streamed via kafka.
